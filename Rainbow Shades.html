    <h2><b><i>The Rainbow Shades</i></b></h2>
    <p> She was like the rainbow shades,<br>
        VIBGYOR and then, the enigma fades. <br>
        I saw her robing every day, <br>
        Orange to pink tint on her cheeks, <br>
        Disrobed, still the rose stays. <br>
        <br>
        Unseen, untouched, her beauty plays, <br>
        Unknown rhythm, her mermaid sways, <br>
        High held head, her aura slays, <br>
        My curious stare to her virgin gaze. <br>
        <br>
        A sacred lily in my greens, <br>
        Wandering-exploring, the curious teens, <br>  
        Her fragrance melding with my veins, <br>
        To taste her charm, min heart leans, <br>
        More than seven, now, she seems. <br>
        <br>
        In her blues, then my soul dips, <br>
        A soft twitch on her honey lips, <br>
        Little glitch. Oh! The drape slips, <br>
        Coming closer. Tighter grip. <br>
        Upside down, everything flips. <br>
        <br>
        I see her all, still I know her not. <br>
        Leaves me always, lost in thought. <br>
        Oh! The VIBGYOR, it veils a lot, <br>
        Hoards it all so, un-adored, <br>
        Remains her beauty, unexplored. <br> </p>
